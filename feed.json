				"content_text": "As part of what will hopefully become a larger post, I'm interested in finding an R way to achieve the following: given an `n x n` matrix of zeroes with a single non-zero element of some value `v`, fill the surrounding entries such that each other element is at most one less than those surrounding it (up or down). For example, with an `8x8` matrix with a value of `5` at `c(5, 5)`, the result would be\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]\n[1,]    0    0    0    0    1    0    0    0\n[2,]    0    0    0    1    2    1    0    0\n[3,]    0    0    1    2    3    2    1    0\n[4,]    0    0    2    3    4    3    2    1\n[5,]    1    2    3    4    5    4    3    2\n[6,]    0    1    2    3    4    3    2    1\n[7,]    0    0    1    2    3    2    1    0\n[8,]    0    0    0    1    2    1    0    0\n````\n\nThis is somewhat akin to imposing a contour density on top of a single peak, but I really can't find any suitable approaches.
