<p>I picked this up browsing shelves in a (particularly <a href="https://playandgo.com.au/dymocks-book-store-rundle-mall-adelaide-review/">beautiful</a>) brick and mortar book store thanks to a voucher I received for a journal article review. So far I&rsquo;m loving it. This was my first introduction to Johanna Drucker&rsquo;s framing of <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html">&ldquo;capta&rdquo;</a> rather than &ldquo;data&rdquo;, the former better reflecting the essence of information being &ldquo;taken and constructed&rdquo; rather than given. Lots to get through yet, but so far very entertaining and insightful.</p>

<p>This was recommended by someone at work and this time I&rsquo;m very glad they did. The author carefully details the history of some of the most significant breakthroughs and, as a physicist, isn&rsquo;t shy with the specifics. It was staggering to me at the start of the book how intertwined the &ldquo;big&rdquo; computer tech (and by extension, media; Lucasfilm, Pixar, &hellip;) companies are and the history they share. By the end of the book these connections are much clearer. I hadn&rsquo;t expected quite the history lesson, but the prevalence of persisting English technology over the much older Chinese inventions becomes well-reasoned. Less fun is the contemplation that maybe we don&rsquo;t currently have an equivalent of Bell Labs fostering such speculative exploration without the need to be profitable in the near future. Even the well-funded but negative revenue companies have the plan to be highly profitable, not a plan to make something better. The <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification">B corporations</a> are a good exception, but they&rsquo;re still not quite &ldquo;loonshot nurseries&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One of the key learnings for me, as someone who works in a Silicon-valley-adjacent biotech startup (hence the recommendation), was that the attitude of creating a &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; technology is backwards. Many technologies can be seen as disruptive in hindsight, but they never start out with that attitude. Incremental improvement with the support to try something different certainly leads there, but it&rsquo;s perhaps too large a leap to try to get there sooner. Having the support to try something different that could be better is the first step towards making something incredible, and it certainly won&rsquo;t work every time, but not trying will absolutely lead to not making it.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don&rsquo;t think it really sunk in while I was working there for nearly five years since I wasn&rsquo;t so read-up on the history, but seeing Genentech mentioned in many of these recent books always makes me do a double-take.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in how big ideas come about and survive, and why others don&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wrapping a (stateless, hit-every-time) REST API and my design was challenged with an alternative opinion - which is great! I get to have a more serious think about design and what might work best. I have an internal function which does the actual talking to the server, e.g. <code>.get_from_API()</code> which needs to know the URL, auth key, and query parameters. I originally designed my package to fetch these from environment variables depending on the API instance (e.g. &lsquo;prod&rsquo; vs &lsquo;dev&rsquo;) and the user (their user-specific key). Individual endpoint wrappers essentially boil down to</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">get_this &lt;- function(something) {
    .get_from_API(construct_endpoint(something))
}
</code></pre><p>I asked the following question on some of the social sites I use:</p>
<hr>
<p>Is there a good reason to use one of these vs the other when wrapping an API?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">get_this(x, ...) # GET
get_that(x, ...) # GET
set_this(x, y, ...) # SET
set_that(x, y, ...) # SET
</code></pre><p>with something like this within each of these</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">greedy_con &lt;- .connect(Sys.getenv(implicit_api_vars), ...)
</code></pre><p>OR</p>
<p>B:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">lazy_con &lt;- .connect(explicit_api_vars, ...)
this(lazy_con, x, ...) # GET
that(lazy_con, x, ...) # GET
this(lazy_con, x) &lt;- y # SET
that(lazy_con, x) &lt;- y # SET
</code></pre><p>(Or some third option)?</p>
<hr>
<p>The motivation for the second option may have come from python where methods on objects are much more common. Indeed, the canonical python version of this wrapper uses</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{python}" data-lang="{python}">lazy_con = NameOfAPI(url = {}, key = {})

lazy_con.this()
lazy_con.that()
</code></pre><p>In R we have dispatch (e.g. S3) so I <em>could</em> assign a class <code>mycon</code> to <code>lazy_con</code> and methods <code>this.mycon()</code> and <code>that.mycon()</code> but this seems very overengineered. Apparently BioConductor also uses this method syntax but there the standard is S4 dispatch (and typically larger data) so a more explicit object might make more sense.</p>
<p>Methods on classes seems to be a common frustration for me in python and rust where I&rsquo;m constantly trying to use some function (e.g. <code>abs(x-y)</code>) which is actually a method (<code>(x-y).abs()</code>) but I think I understand <em>why</em> they&rsquo;re built that way.</p>
<p>So far the responses seem to lean entirely towards hiding the complexity of the connection away. That said, adopting the &lsquo;setter&rsquo; assignment syntax would mean I could do away with the explicit &lsquo;get&rsquo; in the getter function names.</p>
<p>Do you have an opinion on this? Let me know!</p>

<p>I was recommended this on one of the socials and figured it was about time to get around to it. As the &lsquo;first&rsquo; &ldquo;cyber&rdquo; sci-fi book it was well-written and despite being conservative in its predictions for the future, many of these time has proven to be accurate. The pace is reasonable, but by the end it felt a bit like one short story without many offshoots - I&rsquo;m not complaining; perhaps I&rsquo;ve read too many books whose author tried to fill the pages with unnecessary side stories. Worth the read, but probably not one I&rsquo;ll come back to too often.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://jcarroll.xyz/2022/06/29/currently-reading-start.html">posted about this one</a> after a few chapters because it started to get on my nerves. I think I hate-finished it. The author makes some more questionable connections (a bow needs to pulled <em>away</em> from the target&hellip; what?) and continues to write like the reader is definitely American. The argument that Apple fans and Harley riders like iPhones and Harleys because of <em>why</em> the respective companies do what they do never convinced me in the slightest.</p>
<p>The message that the <em>why</em> of a company should be prominent, consistent, and persistent seems fine, I just don&rsquo;t think I liked how that point was made (and taken too far).</p>
<p>Much of the book, particularly the final chapters are great examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a> but the author seems to either be deliberately overlooking that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy this book.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was timely or unfortunate that I read this book so close to <a href="https://jcarroll.xyz/2022/07/09/finished-reading-the.html">The End of Eternity</a> - both had very similar themes, but Asimov is just so good at weaving the threads together into an engrossing story. I think this was a recommendation from Twitter, and while I enjoyed it, it did feel oddly paced. The start felt quite slow - the first half of the book was spent introducing the characters, yet the conclusion seemed to be squashed into the final chapter. Without spoiling too much, there&rsquo;s some <a href="https://youtu.be/u4SEDzynMiQ">bootstrap paradox</a> stuff (as any book involving time-travel should have) that just gets hand-waved away. It&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t think about it too hard.</p>
<p>Overall, not bad. Recommended for a not-too-serious read.</p>

<p>My library had several copies of this on the shelf, so I assumed it was popular or new. The latter is certainly true (2021). This is a collection of short essays detailing the journey from the first analytical machine towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence; c.f. narrow AI such as a digital assistant), specifically noting the significant contributions of women (against the prejudices and biases which are only now slowly being dismantled).</p>
<p>The stories shouldn&rsquo;t be new to anyone, but more light on them is a good thing. The author provides a great level of detail about the contributions and their historical contexts, but borders on misandry with their side remarks. &ldquo;Turn around is fair play&rdquo; one could argue, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s helpful here. The (extremely talented) women who programmed the ENIAC (the domain experts on the mathematical equations they were programming the machine to solve) absolutely deserved the credit for their achievements that was withheld from them, but emphasising &ldquo;the men who built it couldn&rsquo;t program it&rdquo; as if to suggest they just stuck some electronics together and couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what they&rsquo;d built without the women seems disingenuous. Arguing that the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Mac / I&rsquo;m a PC&rdquo; ads specifically only had men in order to reinforce the stereotype that women don&rsquo;t use computers seems like a stretch.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the historical content of this book. The commentary not so much. Others may enjoy it more than I did.</p>

<p>Another break from biology, certainly more towards psychology. This one I found randomly (promoted) at the library and given that it&rsquo;s my kids' school holidays at the moment and they&rsquo;re constantly asking for screens, I figured it was worth a shot. To my surprise, by the end of this book I&rsquo;m encouraged to give my kids <em>more</em> screen time. The big qualifier is the content - the author makes convincing arguments that collaborative games and online chat are the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora">agora</a>, and that kids growing into that world will need to understand, appreciate, and be able to &ldquo;read&rdquo; (&ldquo;be literate in&rdquo;) the new medium. I&rsquo;m not quite convinced that watching YouTube videos of someone playing an extremely basic free game has the same benefit as they propose comes from collaborative gaming or online forums, but I am convinced to start playing Minecraft <em>with</em> my kids.</p>
<p>This book nicely balances historical psychology with up-to-date perspectives. I was surprised to learn that kindergarten (as a concept at all) is only a couple hundred years old. The framing of how previous generations of children have been raised within the applicable social setting (most of us are remnants of the industrial age), plus the entire home vs work distinction breaking down in the new internet-based world makes a lot of sense and encourages me to think about what outdated notions I&rsquo;m imposing on my own kids, especially how those can be limiting. In my current work I make use of mind maps and collaborative documents - why would I not want my children to use the same useful tools for their education?</p>
<p>The latter sections of the book branched out into much wider social commentary - children are growing up within the evolving technological landscape, so it&rsquo;s entirely relevant - and I liked several well-made points about why &ldquo;uninformed inclusion&rdquo; might actually work against goals; why it&rsquo;s not sufficient to just connect everyone and hope they&rsquo;ll be nice; why some people form exclusions against others due to a lack of self-identity; and why online forums are so useful for connecting people, but to the detriment of serendipity.</p>
<p>That last one really hit home - the R community largely calls Twitter home and it&rsquo;s been a fruitful source of friends, collaborators, and inspiration for me, but I do wonder how much of an echo chamber I&rsquo;m stuck it. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to follow some more python and javascript devs.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book to anyone with children who is uncertain about the amount of screen time they&rsquo;re getting. Also just a great read for better understanding the new digital world.</p>

<p>Easily one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. I&rsquo;ve loved many of them, but I haven&rsquo;t read anywhere near all of Asimov&rsquo;s works. I saw this one on a shelf and figured it would be a nice break from the much heavier non-fiction biology I&rsquo;ve been reading lately.</p>
<p>The craftsmanship of Asimov&rsquo;s writing always leaves me pleased. Small callbacks throughout seem effortless; the words never seem to be shoehorned in order to tie together different threads (with other authors, certain sentences have a certain &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun">Chekhov&rsquo;s gun</a>&rsquo; flavour to them).</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this book. Twists and turns, a careful balance of science and hand-waving, and a not-too-overwhelming set of characters. I&rsquo;ll certainly be keeping an eye out for more of Asimov&rsquo;s works to correct my lack of coverage. Recommended to time-travel and general sci-fi enthusiasts.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241958230">Start With Why</a> by Simon Sinek</p>
<p>I was recommended this book by someone whose opinion I hold in high regard, but so far I&rsquo;m not enjoying this book. Not necessarily for the material - I think I can appreciate the points being made about having a defined &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind a company and explanations of the various manipulations a company can leverage rather than actually being better than the competition, but rather the extreme &ldquo;American-ness&rdquo; of the author. Especially surprising since the author has a more diverse background than simply &lsquo;American&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It took 48 pages before a single non-American company was mentioned (Ferarri), and even then it was in the context of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;if you have a family of six a two-seater Ferarri is not better. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for a great way to meet women, a Honda minivan is probably not better&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m long out of the dating scene, but that seems&hellip; like a terrible comparison. Is that part of the purchasing decision? I suppose maybe it is for some, but as a reliable consumer group?</p>
<p>Multiple references to Apple Macs and iTunes being brilliant innovations &ldquo;because people connected with the why of the company&rdquo;. iTunes was a terrible product that was forced onto users in order to use the iPod (a distinct improvement over the removable media competition). My understanding is that it gained significant market share over CDs because it was easier (and potentially cheaper - if you wanted a single song). For myself and many others (the reason I believe it was actually innovative) it was <em>easier</em> than pirating music. A dollar for a song compared to a handful of dollars for a CD or the <em>hassle</em> of downloading and uploading a file - it solved a problem. I don&rsquo;t attribute that to Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;why&rdquo; - another company that offered that might just as well have had the same success.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 seems to end with the explanation that &ldquo;Harley Davidson riders want Harleys&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mac people want something starting with an <em>i</em>&rdquo; and that there&rsquo;s a cult aspect to this based on loyalty above actual product superiority but I don&rsquo;t believe this is grounded in any &ldquo;why&rdquo; of those companies. They&rsquo;ve each done well at convincing buyers to be part of their collective, and they&rsquo;ve each done well at having some features their buyers do appreciate (loud engines or smooth interfaces) but they&rsquo;re both viewed as objectively worse products by people who can be considered unbiased. The example of &ldquo;U2 being iconoclastic&rdquo; and so a joint promotional iPod &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo; got a genuine chuckle from me - did people buy more iPods because U2 were involved? From everything I saw of that time, it was ridiculed. Users had an entire album forced onto their devices that they had no interest in.</p>
<p>Then more &ldquo;everyone is American&rdquo; - I actually had to put the book down during the chapter explaining &ldquo;the biology of belonging&rdquo; with the sentence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go abroad and you&rsquo;ll form instant bonds with other Americans you meet&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other? I&rsquo;m Australian.</p>
<p>I got really upset at repeated references to language structure having some &ldquo;hidden meaning&rdquo;. Is it a coincidence that the phrase is &ldquo;hearts and minds&rdquo; in that order? Or &ldquo;art and science&rdquo;&hellip; No. Not really. Sure, the rules are vague, but it&rsquo;s not particularly meaningful in the way the author hints at. There are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2017/08/31/chips-and-fish-word-order-in-english-collocations/">accepted orderings</a> to some combinations of words known as &ldquo;collocations&rdquo; that &ldquo;make sense&rdquo; to a native English speaker - anyone who hears &ldquo;chips and fish&rdquo; will instantly recognise something is wrong. The &ldquo;i&rdquo; (/ɪ/) in both &ldquo;mind&rdquo; (/maɪnd/) and &ldquo;science&rdquo; (/ˈsaɪ.əns/) fits well into the regular pattern.</p>
<p>The same allusion to the layout of the &ldquo;Golden Circle&rdquo; having some correlation with the physical brain structure reeks of ill-informed motivational speakers and those who say &ldquo;walnuts are good for your brain because they look like a brain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still going to give the rest of the book a chance, but so far it&rsquo;s not rating high.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this book - it started with a good overview of the cellular biology but did move on to more organ-based systems, which was perfect for me. The explanations of the lab and microscopy techniques, advancements, innovations, and discoveries were particularly nice. The detour to examples of academic fraud took a dark turn for such a pleasant book. Recommended for those looking for a nice balance of in-depth science and casual explanations.</p>

<p>Continuing with the technical theme, so far this is a deep dive into the very specific mechanisms of molecular biology without (yet) too much emphasis on particular cells.</p>
<p>What surprised me so far was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (as a technology) is only as old as I am. It&rsquo;s gained a lot of attention thanks to a particular virus we&rsquo;ve all heard too much about. I&rsquo;d never run one of these reactions myself (having not passed through a university biology department) and wasn&rsquo;t aware of the technical details. I had heard various claims by armchair biologists that the COVID PCR test was &ldquo;just detecting the flu&rdquo; and that &ldquo;if you run enough cycles you can find anything&rdquo; but with a better explanation of how it works - primers and temperature cycling - it&rsquo;s clear that&rsquo;s all just a load of nonsense. I&rsquo;m enjoying this one so far.</p>
<p>Also news to me was that RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) is the name applicable to PCR of an RNA virus (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS-CoV-2</a> is) and not a meaningfully different version to PCR in that case, despite <a href="https://www.flysfo.com/travel-well/covid-19-testing">some listings having both</a>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780199673537">Life Unfolding: How the Human Body Creates Itself</a> by Jamie A. Davies</p>
<p>How a single cell develops into a full human, and a lot of the molecular biology along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed this read - every chapter had highly interesting points about the particular pathways involved and how the cells end up &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; to do all the things they do; move where they need to move, align along directions, and proliferate/die. I spent a lot of time pausing my reading, looking up branches of other information and going down other rabbit holes. I read this as a library loan, but I enjoyed it so much I&rsquo;ve bought my own permanent copy.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most (having taken a non-traditional route into biology via physics and programming) - but probably shouldn&rsquo;t have - was how the entire system efficiently re-use mechanisms and pathways for both very early development and for ongoing functionality. I recognised several genes from my cancer immunology work, but I always regarded these as &lsquo;just part of the genetic makeup of a person&rsquo;, not paying attention to how they were critical to actually creating the fully grown person, and are now being repurposed. It&rsquo;s perhaps obvious in hindsight, but there aren&rsquo;t a set of genes for pre-natal growth and another set for adult life. It makes the fact that sometimes these mechanisms fail to work perfectly all the more understandable.</p>
<p>Highly recommend to anyone interested in the very technical details, but a well-presented resource for those generally interested.</p>

<p>This was a nice tour of how the complex mechanisms of DNA replication came to be, and how the process works to produce proteins and phenotypes. This was the first time I really felt I understood the difference between DNA and RNA, and how such a mechanism evolved. Highly recommend to anyone interested in genomics/genetics at a technical level.</p>

			 <p>I <em>love</em> small projects for helping me learn, especially programming. I&rsquo;m still learning Julia, and have found myself wanting more &ldquo;little silly things&rdquo; I can digest and learn from. A lot of the projects I see in Julia are big mathematical models, and I&rsquo;m just not ready to dive that deep yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ted_dunning/status/1435027697386721280?s=20&amp;t=cDVb0XOQRJeOjXoTrOz54w">This series of tweets</a> caught my eye, partly because of the cool animation, but also the bite-sized amount of information it was conveying - that interpolation in Julia can be specified so easily, thanks in large part to the multiple dispatch design of the language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely I could get those 7 lines of code to run&rdquo; I thought.</p>
<p>Entering the code into VScode was straightforward enough, no problems there. I could define the interpolation function</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">interpolate(a, b) = t -&gt; ((1.0-t)*a + t*b)
</code></pre><p>however extending the <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> methods did require me to <code>import Base:*</code> and <code>import Base:+</code> which I think I knew but had forgotten.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">+(f::Function, g::Function) = x -&gt; f(x) + g(x)
*(t::Number, g::Function) = x -&gt; t * g(x)
</code></pre><p>Defining the secondary and tertiary interpolations, also straightforward</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">bz1(p1, p2) = interpolate(p1, p2)
bz2(p1, p2, p3) = interpolate(bz1(p1, p2), bz1(p2, p3))
bz3(p1, p2, p3, p4) = interpolate(bz2(p1, p2, p3), bz2(p2, p3, p4))
</code></pre><p>Now the tricky part - evaluating some of these. I knew that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> represent points, but how to do that here? They&rsquo;re not single numbers, but coordinates. I tried a <code>Tuple</code> as <code>(1, 2)</code> but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work. I do need to remember that <code>interpolate</code> is itself a function of <code>t</code>, so that needs to be specified as well. If I try to interpolate halfway between two &ldquo;points&rdquo; with <code>Tuple</code>s</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">interpolate((0,1), (1,2))(0.5)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching *(::Float64, ::Tuple{Int64,Int64})
Closest candidates are:
  *(::Any, ::Any, ::Any, ::Any...) at operators.jl:538
  *(::Float64, ::Float64) at float.jl:405

</code></pre><p>Okay, how about <code>Array</code>s?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">interpolate([0,1], [1,2])(0.5)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.5
 1.5
</code></pre><p>Huzzah!</p>
<p>After that, it&rsquo;s a matter of generating the points specified by</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">bz3(p1, p2, p3, p4)(t)(t)(t)
</code></pre><p>for various values of <code>t</code>. I did that with a <code>map</code> and joined the results back into a single <code>Array</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">dots = map(i -&gt; bz3(p1, p2, p3, p4)(i)(i)(i),collect(0:0.1:1))
dots = hcat(dots...)
dots

</code></pre><p>That was, I&rsquo;d say, a success.</p>
<p>Drunk with confidence, I wanted to try to reproduce the animation from the tweet, so I dug into the documentation. It didn&rsquo;t seem too bad, and I think I&rsquo;ve managed to reproduce it pretty well</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">anim = @animate for t in collect(vcat(0:0.01:1,1:-0.01:0))
    a = bz3(p1, p2, p3, p4)(t)(t)(t);
    b1 = bz2(p1, p2, p3)(t)(t);
    b2 = bz2(p2, p3, p4)(t)(t);
    c1 = bz1(p1, p2)(t);
    c2 = bz1(p2, p3)(t);
    c3 = bz1(p3, p4)(t);
    stars = hcat(p1, p2, p3, p4);
    diamond1 = hcat(c1, c2);
    diamond2 = hcat(c2, c3);
    square = hcat(b1, b2);
    plot(xlim = (-0.1,2.5), ylim = (-0.1,2.5), legend = false)
    scatter!(dots[1,:], dots[2,:], markersize = 2)
    plot!(diamond1[1,:], diamond1[2,:], markersize = 10, markershape = :diamond, color = :green)
    plot!(diamond2[1,:], diamond2[2,:], markersize = 10, markershape = :diamond, color = :green)
    plot!(square[1,:], square[2,:], markersize = 10, markershape = :square, color = :blue)
    plot!(stars[1,:], stars[2,:], markersize = 10, markershape = :star, color = :purple)
    scatter!(Tuple(a), markersize = 10, markershape = :circle, markercolor = :red)
end

gif(anim, fps = 24)

<p>Moving the points around, I get a new version all of my own</p>
<p><img src="https://jcarroll.xyz/uploads/2022/b776bf8259.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with how these turned out, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot! A gist of the code to make these is hosted here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/27f9b57332424ea50ec2970e74d8e3b3">https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/27f9b57332424ea50ec2970e74d8e3b3</a></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still fairly new to Julia, even though I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn it for a few years. It&rsquo;s <em>extremely</em> powerful (fast, expressive, &hellip; whatever metric you want to use) but with that comes some complexity.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2022/02/25/anyall.html">this post</a> in my feed and it seemed like a great bite-sized chunk of code to learn from. I <em>think</em> I understand everything that&rsquo;s happening, even if I certainly couldn&rsquo;t write that myself, with one exception.</p>
<p>The connection that for <code>Bool</code> data, <code>all()</code> is equivalent to <code>minimum()</code> (it&rsquo;s false as soon as there is one 0, otherwise it&rsquo;s true) and <code>any()</code> is equivalent to <code>maximum()</code> (if there&rsquo;s a 1 it&rsquo;s true) took me a moment, but seems pretty cool. That wasn&rsquo;t the problem I had.</p>
<p>The bit that surprised me was that for <code>ByRow</code> calculations on a <code>DataFrame</code>, <code>minimum()</code> is <strong>faster</strong> than <code>all()</code>. The reason this is so surprising for me is that I understand <code>all()</code> from an R-perspective and my understanding was that <code>all()</code> could short-circuit because as soon as it sees a <code>FALSE</code> it can ignore any other values - the result is guaranteed to be <code>FALSE</code> (yes, yes, up to missingness). Surely, a calculation of <code>minimum()</code> needs to evaluate every value at least once (?). Where this might (must?) fall apart is that I&rsquo;m thinking purely of vectors. Sure enough, checking out some timings on a vector in Julia shows <code>all()</code> is near-instantaneous (after compilation)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{julia}" data-lang="{julia}">x = rand(Bool, 100_000_000)

@time all(x)
  0.009047 seconds (218 allocations: 9.531 KiB, 99.85% compilation time)
false

@time all(x)
  0.000002 seconds
false

@time minimum(x)
  0.091183 seconds (85.03 k allocations: 4.461 MiB, 41.98% compilation time)
false

@time minimum(x)
  0.052287 seconds
false
</code></pre><p>I get similar results, expectedly, from R</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">x &lt;- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1e8, replace = TRUE)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  min = max(x),
  any = any(x),
  times = 10
)
# Unit: nanoseconds
#  expr       min        lq        mean    median        uq       max neval
#   min 208741173 210539351 223219500.3 212388892 222673528 285974960    10

</code></pre><p>So, what&rsquo;s going on? I <em>think</em> the answer is that we&rsquo;re not dealing with just a vector, it&rsquo;s rows from a <code>DataFrame</code>, right? Now, from the R side, that&rsquo;s complicated enough - <code>rowwise()</code> is a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows-in-r-with-the-tidyverse">necessary thing</a> because R stores a <code>data.frame</code> as a list of vectors representing <em>columns</em>, so extracting a row means slicing across those.</p>
<p>I can reproduce the speedup in Julia (and honestly, I struggle to find a clean and fast way to do it in R) but the statement &ldquo;<a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2022/02/25/anyall.html#:~:text=This%20time%20things%20are%20very%20fast%2C%20as%20row%2Dwise%20aggregation%20for%20maximum%20and%20minimum%20is%20optimized.">This time things are very fast, as row-wise aggregation for maximum and minimum is optimized.</a>&rdquo; got me thinking - where should I have learned that? Google isn&rsquo;t showing me any relevant results, so is this just a known thing? I can imagine that such an optimization for doing this might exist, but can anyone provide a reference or guide?? The author of the blog post used this optimization in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/71209103/4168169">StackOverflow answer</a> without challenge (no reference provided) so I feel like it&rsquo;s potentially just something I should know.</p>
